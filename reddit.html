Technology used: Notepad++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Reddit Widget

1.My rational mind, if I came across this situation in the real world would be to use a plug-in and revise the the CSS in the back-end,
however this was a coding test and I felt that simply using Word Press or Joomla was not acceptable. So I went back to something kind
of really, really basic. I am using the API using JS function (s) to pass the widget into the getElementById. This seemed the best way due to time
constraints.

2. Some barriers: I had to understand Reddit first. I never use it. Then I had to research the Reddit API. Then I had to test it
on JS fiddle, because I test EVERYTHING first. Then I obsessed over the CSS, which I tweaked using the inspect element in the browser. Thank you browser.  

3. So overall this entire homework realistically took me 3.5 hours (including written test here). Frankly there are probably better ways to do this, but I wanted to keep the code
simple and clean.  

4. This is NOT complete, but more of a start in my opinion. The r/business feed does populate. It is responsive, go me. There are elements missing that are in the
mock-up. 

5. Thanks :-)! The process is always interesting!
